\section{Research Question}
\section{Research Objectives}
To address this research question, five specific research objectives have been defined:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To create a baseline neural translation model for English to Hindi translation which has the ability to generate above average quality translations by using a large parallel corpus.
    \item To create a new Domain Specific Corpus for the Tourism Domain.
    \item To Fine Tune (Re-Train) the neural translation model by utilizing  a  Hindi Monolingual Corpus.
    \item To Fine Tune (Re-Train) the neural translation model with Domain Specific Training Data.
    \item To Test and Evaluate the neural translation model with Domain Specific Test Data from the Domain Specific Corpus.
\end{enumerate}
