 abstract = {A broadly applicable algorithm for computing maximum likelihood estimates from incomplete data is presented at various levels of generality. Theory showing the monotone behaviour of the likelihood and convergence of the algorithm is derived. Many examples are sketched, including missing value situations, applications to grouped, censored or truncated data, finite mixture models, variance component estimation, hyperparameter estimation, iteratively reweighted least squares and factor analysis.},

    abstract = { Previous neural network learning algorithms for sequence processing are computationally expensive and perform poorly when it comes to long time lags. This paper first introduces a simple principle for reducing the descriptions of event sequences without loss of information. A consequence of this principle is that only unexpected inputs can be relevant. This insight leads to the construction of neural architectures that learn to “divide and conquer” by recursively decomposing sequences. I describe two architectures. The first functions as a self-organizing multilevel hierarchy of recurrent networks. The second, involving only two recurrent networks, tries to collapse a multilevel predictor hierarchy into a single recurrent net. Experiments show that the system can require less computation per time step and many fewer training sequences than conventional training algorithms for recurrent nets. }

abstract="Translating into an Indic language is a challenging task. Indic languages are based on Sanskrit and have rich and diverse grammar. Due to its vast grammar, it requires very large number of complex rules for creating traditional rule based machine translation system. In this work, we have created an Indic machine translation system that utilize recent advancement in the area of machine translation using deep neural architectures. Results presented in this article shows that using neural machine translation we can achieve more natural translation for indic languages such as Hindi that was previously not efficiently possible with rule based or phrase based translation systems.",

abstract="English to Hindi Translator using Translation Memory is a translation tool that transforms an English sentence to its proper Hindi meaning. This translator works on both exact match and fuzzy match. When the input source in English is divided into segments and is completely matched with the database then the appropriate translation for that input is directly fetched from the database. The matching process between the input and the source file is done with the help of Edit Distance Matching algorithm. The case when the input is not 100{\%} matched with the database that is considered as the case of fuzzy match so; in that case N-gram modeling is performed in order to give an appropriate translation to the user. The case in which the input is not completely matched with database (fuzzy match) score is calculated to get the match percentage. The case when the input in the English language is not matched with the database at all, then an appropriate algorithm is used that gives word to word translation of that particular input.",
